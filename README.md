# Personal Expenses

##Author: Beau Saunders

Personal Expenses is free and no money will ever be asked for, but any and all donations are much appreciated

Personal Expenses is a free program that takes your income and outcome for a specific month, gives you a total loss or profit and saves your income, outcome and total profit / loss so that you can view your 'Personal Expenses' for a specific month.

Personal Expenses was built by Beau Saunders who is a fifteen year old, he continues to bring updates and improve Personal Expenses over time but does it in his spare
time so updates can take quite a long time.

If you have any question or requests for the program please send an email to beaujacksaunders@gmail.com

We ask that you please do not copy any of the code from Personal Expenses as it has taken quite a lot of time and effort to create the program, thank you.
